Admin Dashboard with Charts

This project is an Admin Dashboard with Charts built using React, Node.js, and MySQL. It allows the admin to view important data in the form of visual charts, manage users, check system status, and download reports. The dashboard uses JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control to ensure only authorized admins can access the data. It also provides real-time notifications using Socket.io and supports PDF/Excel export. The main purpose of the system is to centralize data, simplify analysis, and help administrators make better decisions quickly.

Why this project :

Instead of checking data manually in MySQL, the Admin Dashboard:

Shows KPIs (total users, quizzes taken, etc.)

Shows charts for trends

Gives reports

The purpose is to simplify data analysis, improve decision-making and provide a central control panel for administrators.
